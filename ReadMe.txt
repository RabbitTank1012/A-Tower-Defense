In this tower defense game, your primary objective is to thwart the advance of enemy aircraft as they strive to reach the designated endpoint, indicated by green marker. 
These aircraft follow a linear trajectory, moving inexorably from the left to the right of the screen. 
Your task involves strategically positioning defensive towers on the grid to engage and inflict damage upon these encroaching foes, adhering to the classic conventions of tower defense gameplay.

What distinguishes this game is the ability to strategically place defensive towers directly on the path taken by the enemy planes. 
This unique twist forces the game's AI to dynamically recalculate the optimal route to the destination based on the defensive towers positioned by the player. 
The enemy aircraft adapt their course by employing the sophisticated A* algorithm to navigate around these obstacles.
